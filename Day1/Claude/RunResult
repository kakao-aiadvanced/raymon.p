<analysis>
This article title exhibits several characteristics of clickbait content:

1. Sensational language: The use of "충격!" (Shock!) at the beginning is a clear attempt to create an emotional response.

2. Withholding information: The title refers to "연예인 A씨" (Celebrity A) without naming the person, creating curiosity and encouraging clicks to find out who it is.

3. Creating mystery: The phrase "그 진실은?" (What's the truth?) at the end is a classic clickbait technique, implying there's more to the story without providing any actual information.

4. Use of large numbers: Mentioning "10억" (1 billion won) is likely intended to grab attention, even if the amount might be accurate.

5. Emotional triggers: The title implies a scandal involving a celebrity and a large sum of money, which is designed to provoke interest and outrage.

While the core information (a celebrity being investigated for embezzlement) may be factual, the presentation is clearly designed to maximize clicks rather than inform. The title is misleading in its presentation and withholds key information, making it a high-level clickbait example.
